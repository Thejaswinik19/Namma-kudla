It is a busy transshipment centre; ships must anchor 3 miles (5 km) offshore because of sandbars, but a deepwater port has been developed for the shipment of mineral ores, petroleum products, and other commodities as well as containers. Cashew nuts, coffee, and sandalwood are brought from the Mysuru and Kodagu (Coorg) regions. Rice, areca nuts, coir yarn (coconut fibre), fish, and cardamom are local products. ',
